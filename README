Hello, Welcome to bhnbot source code

Dependencies:
jansson-devel (for the the configuration file named bhnbot.conf)
libcurl-devel (for anything that uses curl)
pcre-devel (for imgur)



Because ANTRat forgot how to,
here is how to compile:
$ autoreconf --force --install
$ ./configure
$ make
create bhnbot.conf, based on the bhnbot.example.conf file
$ ./bhnbot
